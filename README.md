This Cinema Booking System is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java, allowing users to book movie tickets, manage screenings, and categorize movies.

Key Features:
Movie Categories (Inheritance & Polymorphism)

MovieCategory (Base Class) – Defines common attributes for all movies.
ActionMovie & ComedyMovie (Derived Classes) – Extend MovieCategory with unique properties like intensity and humor level​
​
.
Movie Screenings (Encapsulation)

MovieScreening manages seat availability and screening details​
.
Booking System (Encapsulation & Association)

Booking stores customer details and ticket reservations​
.
BookingManager handles movie additions, screenings, and ticket bookings​
.
User Interaction (Main Program)

Main class provides a menu-driven system for users to add movies, screenings, book tickets, and view details​
.
OOP Concepts Used:
✅ Encapsulation – Movie and booking details are stored privately with getter methods.
✅ Inheritance – ActionMovie & ComedyMovie inherit from MovieCategory.
✅ Polymorphism – Overridden displayAdditionalInformation() for different movie categories.
✅ Abstraction – The system hides complex details, allowing users to interact with a simple interface.
